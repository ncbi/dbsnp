    Note:
          Input file is the file generated by the C++ grafpop program that includes subject ancestry scores.
          Samples and ancestry scores will be saved to the output file as plain texts.

    Options:
        Set a rectangle area to retrieve subjects from graph of GD2 (y) vs. GD1 (x)
            -xcmin   min x value
            -xcmax   max x value
            -ycmin   min y value
            -ycmax   max y value
            -isByd:  retrieve subjects whose values are beyond the above rectangle

        Set minimum and maximum numbers of genotyped fingerprint SNPs for samples to be processed
            -minsnp  minimum number of SNPs with genotypes
            -maxsnp  maximum number of SNPs with genotypes

        Set population cutoff lines
            -ecut    proportion: cutoff European proportion dividing Europeans from other populations. Default 90%.
            -fcut    proportion: cutoff African proportion dividing Africans from other populations. Default 95%.
                                 Set it to -1 to combine African and African American populations
            -acut    proportion: cutoff East Asian proportion dividing East Asians from other populations. Default 95%.
                                 Set it to -1 to combine East Asian and Other Asian populations
            -ohcut   proportion: cutoff African proportion dividing Latin Americans from Other population. Default 13%.
            -fhcut   proportion: cutoff African proportion dividing Latin Americans from African Americans. Default 40%.
